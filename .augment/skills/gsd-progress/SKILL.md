## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-progress` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action - either executing an existing plan or creating the next one.

Provides situational awareness before continuing work.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute the progress workflow from @D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/progress.md end-to-end.
Preserve all routing logic (Routes A through F) and edge case handling.
