## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-check-todos` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
List all pending todos, allow selection, load full context for the selected todo, and route to appropriate action.

Routes to the check-todos workflow which handles:
- Todo counting and listing with area filtering
- Interactive selection with full context loading
- Roadmap correlation checking
- Action routing (work now, add to phase, brainstorm, create phase)
- STATE.md updates and git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/check-todos.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional area filter)

Todo state and roadmap correlation are loaded in-workflow using `init todos` and targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the check-todos workflow** from `@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/check-todos.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Todo existence checking
2. Area filtering
3. Interactive listing and selection
4. Full context loading with file summaries
5. Roadmap correlation checking
6. Action offering and execution
7. STATE.md updates
8. Git commits
</process>
