## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-analyze-dependencies` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Analyze the phase dependency graph for the current milestone. For each phase pair, determine if there is a dependency relationship based on:
- File overlap (phases that modify the same files must be ordered)
- Semantic dependencies (a phase that uses an API built by another phase)
- Data flow (a phase that consumes output from another phase)

Then suggest `Depends on` updates to ROADMAP.md.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md.

Run this command BEFORE `/gsd-manager` to fill in missing `Depends on` fields and prevent merge conflicts from unordered parallel execution.
</context>

<process>
Execute the analyze-dependencies workflow from @D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md end-to-end.
Present dependency suggestions clearly and apply confirmed updates to ROADMAP.md.
</process>
