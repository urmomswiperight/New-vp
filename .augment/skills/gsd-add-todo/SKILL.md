<augment_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-add-todo` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Augment tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `launch-process` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `str-replace-editor` for editing existing files
- `view` for reading files and listing directories
- `save-file` for creating new files
- `grep` for searching code (or use MCP servers for advanced search)
- `web-search`, `web-fetch` for web queries
- `add_tasks`, `view_tasklist`, `update_tasks` for task management

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use the built-in subagent spawning capability
- Define agent prompts in `.augment/agents/` directory

<objective>
Capture an idea, task, or issue that surfaces during a GSD session as a structured todo for later work.

Routes to the add-todo workflow which handles:
- Directory structure creation
- Content extraction from arguments or conversation
- Area inference from file paths
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Todo file creation with frontmatter
- STATE.md updates
- Git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: {{GSD_ARGS}} (optional todo description)

State is resolved in-workflow via `init todos` and targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the add-todo workflow** from `@D:/New-vp-main/.augment/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Directory ensuring
2. Existing area checking
3. Content extraction (arguments or conversation)
4. Area inference
5. Duplicate checking
6. File creation with slug generation
7. STATE.md updates
8. Git commits
</process>
